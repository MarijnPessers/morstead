## Rule Engine API
For local development, you can start up the docker container from docker hub using this command:

```bash
docker run -p 5088:80 virtualsociety/vsrulesopenapi
```

This will bring up the server on port 5088 localhost. 

Once running, you can load the swagger documentation on how to use the API on: 

http://localhost:5088

* You can also test from the swagger user interface
* You can obtain CURL commands from swagger that you can use from bash/commandline

If you like you can change the portnumber as you desire.
